C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language. It was first introduced in 1985 and provides object-oriented features like classes and inheritance. C++ is widely used in various applications like game development, system programming, embedded systems, and high-performance computing.
C++ is a statically-typed language, meaning that the type of a variable is determined during compilation, and has an extensive library called the C++ Standard Library, which provides a rich set of functions, algorithms, and data structures for various tasks.
C++ builds upon the features of C, and thus, most C programs can be compiled and run with a C++ compiler.

Example:-
  #include<iostream>
  int add(int a, int b){
      return a + b;
    }
  class Calculator
  public:
    int multiply(int a, int b){
        return a + b;
      }
  };

  int main(){
      int x = 5;
      int y = 3;
      
      int sum = add(x, y);
      std::cout<<"Sum: "<<sum<<std::endl;

      Calculator calc;
      int product = calc.multiply(x, y);
      std::cout<<"Product: "<<product<<std::endl;

      return 0;
    }
